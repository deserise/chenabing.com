            <p class="m-t-25">Exciting new scientific research shows that hemp extract contains special relief molecules called cannabinoids or Hemp which bind to receptor cites in the brain and body. When taken orally, Hemp Gummies activates these receptors, and soothing comfort begins to take form.</p>

              <strong>Why This New Technology Is Better Than Hemp</strong>
            </p>
            <p class="m-t-25">Unfortunately, most Hemp found on the market can’t deliver a fraction of these results. “The problem is, hemp products sold on Amazon do not contain any Hemp whatsoever, and then, companies selling real Hemp typically come in oil form,” according to Chief Technologist Mi Hwa Kim of the Green Gardener. “Oil doesn’t breach the cell membrane, which is where the real healing happens. Our body is 80% water, our cells 90%. And you know what they say about oil and water -- they don’t mix.”</p>
            <p class="m-t-25">This is why Hemp Gummies contains a unique “water soluble” system. The technology is shown to improve absorption in the cells by 450%, quickly boosting the body’s cannabinoid levels.</p>

            </a>
            <p class="">“The other problem is that most of these formulas only contain a single compound extract,” says Ms. Kim. “Hemp’s cannabinoids are shown to work synergistically. In short, they work better together. It’s called the “entourage effect.” Most miss out on the full effects because they are missing some of the best rejuvenating compounds within the hemp plant. This is why we’ve made

            <p class="m-t-25">“Finally, most Hemp formulas are made on foreign farms with pesticides, or grown using non-organic seeds and processes. We’ve grown the hemp in Hemp Gummies at a 100% organic farm, under strict agricultural guidelines. It’s grown without pesticides or GMOs. And it’s grown to contain NO THC which we have the test results to prove it.”</p>

              <br>
              <br>"I was plagued by the symptoms of Fibromyalgia and arthritis. I couldn't get out of bed. I was in pain constantly. And the 'Cures' were worse than the symptoms. They had me on harsh drugs. I was bed-ridden and severely depressed. My life was over."
              <br>
              <br>"Just a few days after I started taking Hemp Gummies, I started noticing a difference. My pain has drastically reduced. I had energy again. I've been taking them for 4 months now - And

                <strong>How It Works</strong>
              </p>
              <p class="m-t-25">The key to Hemp Gummies’s health benefits is the Endocannabinoid system, a network of receptors in the cells. The system is there to maintain homeostasis (balance). In response to toxins in our body, it releases cannabinoids to set things back to their natural state.</p>
              <p class="m-t-25">“It’s really amazing God-given system that’s been completely overlooked. Our bodies are practically designed to work with the compounds in Hemp, which is why we need a solution like Hemp Gummies that unleashes its full potential.”</p>
              <p class="m-t-25">Over time, with aging, the endocannabinoid system eventually burns out. Fewer cannabinoids are released, so the body’s levels deplete. The result is, all sorts of symptoms of aging like age-related memory loss, blurry vision, joint discomfort, aches and pains, anxiety, depression, sleep disorders, and other ailments.</p>
              <p class="m-t-25">In fact, a recent study revealed that
                <strong>60% of users say Hemp is “more effective” than prescription medications.</strong>75% found Hemp more effective than over-the-counter products, as you can see below:</p>
